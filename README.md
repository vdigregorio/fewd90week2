## Mark-Up and Style a Landing Page

Your job is to build out the Relaxr landing page using the information below.

### Step 1 - Fork this repository.

From the assignment homepage (https://github.com/fewd90nyc/fewd90week2), click the "Fork" link on the top right. This will create a copy of the assignment in YOUR github account.

### Step 2 - Clone your forked repository.

From the repository homepage (which will be http://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/fewd90week2), click on green "Clone or Download" button and "Open in Desktop". This should open your Github Desktop App and prompt you to save the fewd90week2 folder on your computer. I suggest saving it in the same directory as you saved fewd90week1.

### Step 3 - Build!

Following the text in `copy.txt` and the styles defined in `design.txt`, add HTML and CSS to make the site resemble `screenshot.png` as much as possible.

### Step 4 - Commit and Sync

Work on your website locally and view it in the browser by opening your index.html file. When your site looks good, Commit and Sync with the Github App.

### Step 5 - Pull Request

Send a Pull Request to submit your homework. From your fewd90week2 page on github.com (https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/fewd90week2), click on the "New Pull Request" button and follow the prompts. 

### Step 6 - Publish with [Gitbot](http://gitbot.co/)! (optional)

Want to post your fewd90week2 project on your github.io url? Log into gitbot and click the fewd90week2 repository button and VOILA! It will (perhaps after a few minutes) be viewable online at http://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/fewd90week2
